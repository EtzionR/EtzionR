Each repository includes:
- The python code that developed as part of the project
- Implementation python file which demonstrates the use of the code
- Readme file that details exactly how it works (including visualization, explanations & math equations)
- Examples of importing and using the code
- Examples file to apply the code on them, as well as outputs files
- Descreption of required python libraries
