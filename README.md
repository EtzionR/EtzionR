## Welcome to my Github-Portfolio

Here you can find Generic Python codes in the field of **Data Science**. The repositories touch the following topics:
- **Machine & Deep Learning**
- **Algorithms**
- **Geometry & GIS**
- **Visualization**
- **Projects in specific areas**

You can watch the repositories and the topics that relevant to them:
